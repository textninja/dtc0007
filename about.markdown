# Nearly a real blog

This site was built as my daily tech challenge for January 5th. It's a
continuation of a prior challenge, which was to create a basic Jekyll blog, but
this time we're going granular by zooming all the way in to the blog post level,
creating a [complete blog post]({% link _posts/2022-01-05-build-complete-blog-post-in-jekyll.md %}) with this tool.
