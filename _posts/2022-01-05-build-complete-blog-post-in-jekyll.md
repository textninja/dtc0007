Today, we're going meta. Time is at a premium, so instead of doing a tech
challenge *and* a blog post, my blog post *is* my tech challenge, which makes
this the opportune time to right the wrongs of yesterday and create something in
Jekyll that actually feels like a legitimate use of the tool.

I followed many of the same steps for setup as yesterday, only this time it went
quicker because I didn't need to consult the docs quite so much. Practice makes
faster.

I placed an emphasis on simple, mobile friendly styles. Actually, I didn't
bother with a desktop design at all this time.

I intended to incorporate an offline webpack build for some JavaScript
enhancements to posts and templates, but ended up using CSS exclusively. I'd
never built a CSS-only hamburger menu before, and while I'd still prefer
JavaScript in any serious context, :focus-within and :focus give me all the
tools I need to make things work sans-scripting.
