Today, we're going meta. Time is at a premium, so instead of doing a tech
challenge *and* a blog post, my blog post *is* my tech challenge, which makes
this the opportune time to right the wrongs of yesterday and create something in
Jekyll that actually feels like a legitimate use of the tool.

## My process

I followed many of the same steps for setup as yesterday, only this time it went
quicker because I didn't need to consult the docs quite so much. Practice makes
faster.

I placed an emphasis on simple, mobile friendly styles. Actually, I didn't
bother with a desktop design at all this time.

I intended to incorporate an offline webpack build for some JavaScript
enhancements to posts and templates, but ended up using CSS exclusively. I'd
never built a CSS-only hamburger menu before, and while I'd still prefer
JavaScript in any serious context, :focus-within and :focus give me all the
tools I need to make things work sans-scripting. I say CSS, but I mean SCSS. I
made full use of Jekyll's built-in preprocessor.

I think some subtle parallax would be a nice and modest touch, and I need to
pick a highlight color for links, but the design is coming along. I steered
clear of web fonts, because I want to keep the load time snappy.

## What a blog post needs

Today's goal is to write "complete" blog post. So what is that? To really cover
all the bases, I feel I need to include a number of things in a blog post.

1. Good writing. Subjective, and I don't feel I'm there yet, but I expect this
   to improve steadily with time. That's one muscle that is surely being
   exercised when I blog.
2. Good content. Not only do I need to write well, but I need to pick a subject
   worth writing about, and actually have something to say.
3. Pretty pictures. I'm no artist. But even if I were to dabble here, my blog
   could get much more visually interesting
4. Interactivity where needed. I need to take full advantage of the features of
   the medium instead of just working around its challenges. A web post can be
   so much more than a digital piece of paper with writing on it.
